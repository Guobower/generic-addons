Generic Location is a module developed by the Center of Research &
Development company.

It allows you to make an abstract description of the objects location
relative to the general location (for example: house3 ▶️ office5 ▶️
room2 ▶️ table5).

Each sub-location may have many own sub-locations, so that you can
easily describe complex objects using a tree-like structure.

The module is designed for use with other Odoo applications and modules
and can extend its functionality depending on the installed modules.

Main Features of the Generic Location Module:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   objects.*
