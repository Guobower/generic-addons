Generic Location
================

Generic Location is a module developed by the Center of Research &
Development company.

It allows you to make an abstract description of the objects location
relative to the general location (for example: house3 ▶️ office5 ▶️
room2 ▶️ table5).

Each sub-location may have many own sub-locations, so that you can
easily describe complex objects using a tree-like structure.

The module is designed for use with other Odoo applications and modules
and can extend its functionality depending on the installed modules.
