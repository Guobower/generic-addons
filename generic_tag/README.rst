Generic Tag
===========

Generic Tag is a module developed by the Center of Research &
Development company. It allows you to create and categorize generic tags
(keywords).

With these tags in other applications, you can use the logic associated
with them (for example, search and filter objects by tags).

Integration with other modules is realized with the help of additional
modules.
