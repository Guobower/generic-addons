Generic Condition Module
========================

Generic Condition is a module developed by the Center of Research &
Development company. The module allows you to create generic conditions
on which you can program some logic in Odoo objects.

You can set different conditions for changing stages, appointing
responsible persons, automatically triggering events, etc., so that your
everyday business processes can proceed more smoothly and automated.

Generic Condition module is integrated and can be used with other Odoo
applications with additional modules.
